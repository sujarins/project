# HANGMAN HANDMAN
This project is project in image analytic course, which is required subjects of Master degree. The project were done by my team (5 people included me)
### Background:
My team would like to develop a game that can be played without the tools like a keyboard or mouse. We selected the Hangman game, in which a player has to guess a word by letter, one at a time until they fill in the word or lose. Instead of inputting letters by keyboard, the player has to draw alphabet letters in the air and we use the laptop's camera to detect the player's fingers and then predict that alphabet letter to guess a word in the game.

### Objective project: To apply image analytic (by using Tensorflow) to real practices.



<br><br>

### Dataset training model : EMNIST Letters: 145,600 characters. 26 balanced classes.

<br><br>

### Image processing

<br><br>

### Method

<br><br>

### Limitation:
- Our model can only predict English letters.
- Our game still has to require a mouse at first to select word catagories.
